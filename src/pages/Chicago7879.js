      <p>These photographs were made between 1978 and 1979 in various Chicago neighborhoods while working as an artist-in-residence with the Chicago Council on Fine Arts. Selections of this work have been exhibited at Alibi Fine Art (“Chicago 78/79”, June 2013 and the Harold Washington Library in Chicago (“Straight Into the Camera”, December 2015 – May 2016).</p>

      “This was a dream assignment! All I was asked (and paid!) to do was to walk around selected neighborhoods and take pictures. Most people I approached were more than happy, and proud to pose for me.”
