      <p>This photo documentary of small family-owned-and-operated businesses was made as part of my M.A. thesis while attending Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL between 1976 and 1977, and with the support of a humanities grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1980. Darkroom contact prints were made from 5 x 7” negatives. Enlarged 11 x 14” inkjet prints were made for an exhibit at Alibi Fine Art (“Family Run”, January 2011).

      “What started out as bicentennial tribute to Midwestern, family-driven, entrepreneurial spirit turned into a cross-country search for families living the American dream . . . for better and for worse.”
